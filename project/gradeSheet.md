| **Report document**
| Introduction (4 pts)                         | 3.5 no paper structure
| Methods (4 pts)                              | 4
| Results (4 pts)                              | 2.5 more discussion of weak scaling needed. Not clear why time went UP linearlyly
| Conclusions (4 pts)                          | 3 sparse
| Figures (3 pts)                              | 3
| References (2 pts)                           | 2
| **Specific project requirements**
| At least two parallel paradigms (4 pts)      | 4
| Different parallelization strategies [3 pts] | 3
| Verification test [3 pts]                    | 0 Seems implementation was NOT tested for correctness in parllel
| Scaling/performance studies (3 pts)          | 3
| Load balancing (2 pts)                       | 2
| Memory usage (2 pts)                         | 1 Memory _scaling_ not discussed
| Use of HDF5 for I/O (2 pts)                  | 1 could have used for storing final matrix
| **Total (40 pts):**                          | 32
