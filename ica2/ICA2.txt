1. Our group is group 4, Robert Branson, Alex McKim, and Danqi Qu
2. 2N^3. There are 3 for loop iterating over N, and two operations per iteration, so 2N^3.
3. 747 Mflops/s
4. The macbook pro used has a 2.6 Ghz processor, so the peak performance (assuming one flop per clock cycle) is 2,600 Mflops/sec. What was measured is about 1/3 of this peak performance.
5. See attached files.
6. The system used for this project is a macbook pro with 9 MB of L3 cache and a 2.6 GHz processor. The graph shows that the performance rised linearly in three separate sections from N=2 to 25, then N=25 to 60, then N=60 to 100. Each of these sections transition points probably correspond to the accessing of different levels of cache. This region corresponds to where the algorithm is bandwidth bound. The graph then flattens and becomes fairly constant from around N=100 onward to 1600 (where it ends). This region corresponds to where the algorithm is compute bound.
